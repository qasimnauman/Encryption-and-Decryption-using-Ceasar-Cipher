# **Encryption and Decryption using Ceasar Cipher**  
An effective system made to enrypt and then decrypt a plain text message effectively.  
We used the Irvine32 Library given by Kipp Irvine for developing in assembly language.  
This program effectively converts the plain text message given by the user to encrypted text using the Ceasar Shift Algorithm. The value of key can be changed before running the code. As the text is encrypted then the key is required to effectively decrypt the cipher text and to also change the plain text.  
The ASM file is uploaded in this repository for refernce.

## **Challenges Faced**  
As it was developed in assembly langugage so me with my other team mates had to work very carefully as we were directly working with regiser to handle data, a slight change caused the code to collapse and errors to occur.
